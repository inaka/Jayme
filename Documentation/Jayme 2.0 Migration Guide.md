# Jayme 2.0 Migration Guide

**Jayme 2.0** is the latest major release of Jayme. As a major release, following Semantic Versioning conventions, 2.0 introduces several API-breaking changes that one should be aware of.

This guide is provided in order to ease the transition of existing applications using Jayme 1.x to the latest APIs, as well as explain the design and structure of new and changed functionality.

### Automatically Suggested Changes

There are some compiler migration mechanisms that have been implemented in Jayme 2.0 by leveraging the `@unavailable` attribute in a `Compatibility.swift` file.

***For these changes you only have to follow the compiler suggestions and they should be applied automatically.***

For instance:

* `ServerRepository` has been renamed to `CRUDRepository`. 
  * The compiler will automatically suggest the replacement of `ServerRepository` to `CRUDRepository`.

### Manual Changes

However, there are some other changes that would have required overwhelming (if ever possible) mechanisms to be implemented in order to keep automatic suggestions from the compiler. In consequence, we decided not to implement them but to write them down here in a separated list.

⚠️ ***Therefore, it's up to you to perform these changes manually.***

They are listed below:

- `path` variable has been renamed to `name` in `Repository` protocol declaration. (related issue: [#17](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/17))
  - You have to change every `path` appearance in your Repositories by using `name` instead.
- `init?(dictionary: StringDictionary)` has been replaced by `init(dictionary: [String: AnyObject]) throws`. (related issues: [#25](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/25), [#28](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/28))
  - `StringDictionary` → `[String: AnyObject]` replacements should be suggested by the compiler.
  - You have to manually replace your `init?` initializers for every class or struct that conforms to `DictionaryInitializable` by its throwable equivalent.
  - You have to perform `{ throw JaymeError.ParsingError }` whenever you can't initialize a `DictionaryInitializable` object instead of performing `{ return nil }`.
- `Identifier` typealias no longer exists. Now your entities define their own identifier type.  (related issue: [#22](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/22))

  - You have to change every `Identifier` appearance and replace it by a concrete type you need to use (e.g. `String`, `Int`, or your own, as long as it conforms to `CustomStringConvertible`). This change should be suggested by the compiler.
  - However, since by default `String` does not conform to `CustomStringConvertible`, you'd probably want to add this extension to your code: 
    - `extension String: CustomStringConvertible { public var description: String { return self } }`
- Convenient parsing functions under one of the extensions in `ServerRepository` (now `CRUDRepository`) have been moved into separated new classes called `DataParser` and `EntityParser`. If you were calling those functions somewhere in your code, you have to change their calls to use those parsers classes instead of your repository itself. (related issue: [#20](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/20))
  - Possible replacements are:
    - `self.parseDataAsArray(…)` → `DataParser().dictionariesFromData(…)`
    - `self.parseDataAsDictionary(…)` → `DataParser().dictionaryFromData(…)`
    - `self.parseEntitiesFromArray(…)` → `EntityParser().entitiesFromDictionaries(…)`
    - `self.parseEntityFromDictionary(…)` → `EntityParser().entityFromDictionary(…)`
- Results from Repositories using `NSURLBackend` (ex `ServerBackend`) are now returned on the main thread, instead of on a background thread.
  - This will not break your existing code, but it's strongly recommended that you remove any possible `dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue()) { ... }` call that you could have performed within your ViewControllers when getting results back from any repository. These calls are unnecessary now.

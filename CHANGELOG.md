## 4.1.0

- Migrated to Swift 4 (Issue [#109](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/109))

## 4.0.0

- `CRUDRepository` protocol no longer exists. Its functionalities have now been divided into four separate protocols: `Creatable`, `Readable`, `Updatable` and `Deletable`. (Issue [#84](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/84))
- `PagedRepository` protocol no longer exists. Its `findByPage(pageNumber:)` method has been moved to the `Readable` protocol and has a new signature: `read(pageNumber:pageSize:)`.  (Issue [#95](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/95))
- `findAll()` has been renamed to `readAll()` in the `Readable` protocol (Issue [#87](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/87]))
- `find(byId:)` has been renamed to `read(id:)` in the `Readable` protocol (Issue [#87](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/87]))
- `update(_)` has been renamed to `update(_, id:)` in the `Updatable` protocol; a new `update(_)` function has been added (Issue [#87](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/87]))
- `delete(_)` has been renamed to `delete(id:)` in the `Deletable` protocol (Issue [#87](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/87]))
- Added `create([entity1, entity2, …])` function in the `Creatable` protocol (Issue [#87](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/87]))
- Added `read()` function in the `Readable` protocol (Issue [#87](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/87])) 
- Added `update([entity1, entity2, …])` function in the `Updatable` protocol (Issue [#87](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/87]))
- Added `delete()` function in the `Deletable` protocol (Issue [#87](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/87]))

## 3.0.0

- All of the changes involved in this release are due to [Swift 3 breaking changes](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/) and its [new APIs design](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/).

## 2.0.1

- `create(...)` function in `CRUDRepository` no longer attaches the `:id` parameter in its `POST` URL. (Issue [#63](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/63))
- Results from repositories are now returned on the main thread. (Issue [#55](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/55))
- Added `PATCH` verb in `HTTPMethodName` enumeration. (Issue [#57](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/57))

## 2.0.0

#### Repository related changes

- `path` variable has been renamed to `name` in `Repository` protocol declaration. (Issue [#17](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/17))
- `ServerRepository` has been renamed to `CRUDRepository`. (Issue [#19](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/19))
- `PagedRepository` no longer conforms to `CRUDRepository` (ex `ServerRepository`); now it conforms directly to `Repository`. (Issue [#20](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/20))
- `create(…)` and `update(…)` methods in `CRUDRepository` now return `Future<EntityType, JaymeError>` instead of `Future<Void, JaymeError>`, containing the created or updated entity. (Issue [#37](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/37))
- Convenient parsing functions have been plucked out from `CRUDRepository` (ex `ServerRepository`) and put into new classes named `DataParser` and `EntityParser`.  (Issue [#20](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/20))

#### Backend related changes

- `ServerBackend` protocol has been renamed to `NSURLSessionBackend`. (Issue [#18](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/18))
- `ServerBackendConfiguration` has been renamed to `NSURLSessionBackendConfiguration`. (Issue [#18](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/18))

#### Entity related changes

- `init?(dictionary)` has been replaced by `init(dictionary) throws` in `DictionaryInitializable` protocol. (Issue [#25](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/25))
- `StringDictionary` typealias has been removed. (Issue [#28](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/28))
- `Identifier` typealias has been removed. (Issue [#22](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/22))
- `id` variable in `Identifiable` protocol no longer works with `Identifier`. Now it uses an associated type (`IdentifierType`) for that. (Issue [#22](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/22))

#### Error handling related changes

- `ServerBackendError` has been renamed to `JaymeError`. (Issue [#21](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/21))
- `case BadURL` in `JaymeError` (ex `ServerBackendError`) has been renamed to `case BadRequest` and now it also covers a scenario where request parameters can't be parsed into a valid JSON object. (Issue [#49](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/49))

#### Bug Fixes

- `parameters` are now actually used in `NSURLSessionBackend` (ex `ServerBackend`). (Issue [#49](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/49))
- `"Content-Type": "application/json"` header is no longer duplicated in requests. (Issue [#50](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/issues/50))
